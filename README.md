# Loan_Defaulters

For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back

The data that we have is from 2007-2010.

Problem Statement
Using the Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.

About the Dataset
The snapshot of the data you will be working on:

dt_dataset

A zipped file containing the following items is given:

train.csv
The data file train.csv contains the 7662 instances with the 15 features including the target feature.

test.csv
The datafile test.csv contains the 1916instances with the 14 features excluding the target feature.

sample_submission.csv
Explained under the Submission sub-heading

Loan_Defaulters_Data_Dictionary.csv
The file contains data dictionary(Dictionary explaining what each feature of the dataset means) of the Insurance Claim dataset

Loan_Defaulters_Student_Template.ipynb
A template notebook explaining the task breakdown to solve the given problem statement (Learners are recommended to use it)

Submission
After training the model on train.csv data, the learner has to predict the target feature of the test.csv data using the trained model. The learner has to then submit a CSV file with the predicted feature.

Sample submission file(sample_submission.csv) is given to you as a reference to the format expected when you submit

Evaluation metrics
For this particular dataset, we are using accuracy_score as the evaluation metric.

Submissions will be evaluated based on accuracy_score as per the below threshold.

Your accuracy_score score	Points earned for the Task
0.83 <= accuracy_score	100% of the available points
0.81 <= accuracy_score < 0.83	80% of the available points
0.79 < accuracy_score < 0.81	70% of the available points
accuracy_score <= 0.79	No points earned
